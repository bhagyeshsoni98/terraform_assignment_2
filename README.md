# Terraform Advance Assignment

## **TASK :**
Create a 3-tier application environment using Terraform with the following requirements:
 1. It has 1 VPC with a CIDR range 10.10.0.0/21
 2. It has  2 private subnets where each subnet has 25% of the IPs
 3. It has  2 public subnets where each subnet has 25% of the IPs
 4. It has NAT gateways for the private subnets
 5. It has internet gateways for the public subnets
 6. Build an EKS cluster across public and private subnets
     - Built with HPA and autoscaling ( 50% reserved instances + 50% spot instances)
    - Inbuilt security and credential management.
    - Ingress controller with Nginx for the presentation layer 
    1. It has a front-end or presentation tier with:
        - A public load balancer that allows all traffic that allows requests on port 80
        - Nginix with atleast 2 replica sets running dockers listening on port 80
    2. It has a back-end or application tier (API) with:
        - A load balancer that is only accessible from the presentation tier’s ec2s
        - Any application server that can host PHP applications (Apache for e.g. 3 replica sets) running dockers listening on port 80
    3. It has a database or data tier with the following:
        - An RDS running the latest version
        - Accessible only from the application tier’s ec2s
        - Credentials are stored in secrets manager:
          - Username: admin
          - Password: <auto-generated>
    4. There should be a bastion server in a public subnet for SSH tunneling to all the docker containers (Nice to have).
